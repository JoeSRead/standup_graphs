# standup_graphs
A fun project aiming to create better mixed standup gorups

Previous standup groups were random but had a number of issues; they didn't promote good inter-team mixing, and they had to be manually checked over to ensure good grouping.

The new method has three main ideas behind it; 
1) Line managers can never be in the same group as their direct report
2) One and only one line manager needs to be in each group
3) Groups should prioritise mixing people together by taking prior groupings into account
